    Part #1: Natural language processing and conversion to Prolog queries/programs
    Part #2: Main engine - sets of rules used to solve your chosen problem
    Part #3: All integrated through a graphical interface

# Challenge
Query Plan: Given a database of geographical sites (countries, rivers, forests etc), your program should be able to parse a question in natural language and translate it to a database query (a la Prolog), execute the query and use a graphical interface to represent the input and output.
